# Genesis ReLoop Platform - Complete Architecture & Feature Description

## Platform Overview

Genesis ReLoop is a cutting-edge decentralized circular economy platform built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript. It connects waste suppliers, processors, and buyers through an AI-powered marketplace, focusing on transforming food waste and used cooking oil (UCO) into valuable resources through Short Renewable Loops (SRL).

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom mythic-tech themed components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom mythic-tech design system
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state with React hooks
- **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with WebAuthn/Passkeys support
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon integration (planned) for smart contracts
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for AI agents
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Netlify with edge functions

### Security Architecture (DARPA-Level)
- **Encryption Layers**:
  - In-Transit: TLS 1.3 + Post-Quantum hybrid (X25519+Kyber)
  - At-Rest: AES-256-GCM with hardware-backed keys (TPM/HSM)
  - Field-Level: Encrypted PII with searchable encrypted indexes
  - Post-Quantum: Kyber512/768 for key exchange, Dilithium2 for signatures
  - Confidential Compute: TEE attestation (SGX/TDX/SEV) for agent execution

- **Zero-Knowledge Validation**:
  - Prove batch quality thresholds without revealing sensor data
  - Prove chain-of-custody continuity without exposing handlers
  - Prove carbon credit calculations with Groth16/PLONK proofs
  - On-chain Merkle roots with IPFS/Arweave proof artifacts

- **Access Control**:
  - WebAuthn + Passkeys + Hardware keys (YubiKey/NFC)
  - DID/VC roles for all participants
  - Just-in-time scoped tokens with device posture checks
  - Geo/route geofencing for collectors
