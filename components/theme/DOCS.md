# Genesis Recursive Fractal Mythic-Tech Theme

**Quintuple Stack** per component:
1. Earthly: palette, glass-obsidian substrate.
2. Recursion: toroidal hints / loop borders.
3. Fractal: static Mandelbulb-esque gradient (no heavy canvases by default).
4. Mythic: watermark glyph pulse (low opacity).
5. Tech: blueprint labels on hover/focus.

**Motion:** slow, cancellable, respects reduced-motion.
**Accessibility:** WCAG AA, high-contrast friendly, focus ring = emerald.
